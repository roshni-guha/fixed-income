## Considerations
We want a model that provides a trigger to take overweight/underweight positions in each class based on technical data. 
This model can be updated as frequently as works best, but note that we only trade once a month, so while shorter-term position changes may work, we won’t frequently use them unless there is some large event that warrants trading (Covid, Liberation Day, etc) 
This model would advise our strategy and be a factor in our overweight/underweight decisions, but it wouldn’t be the sole factor since we invest based on fundamentals, not technicals. 
Consider that we have trading costs – around 3-5 bps of spread on each buy/sell in IG and 5-7 bps of spread on each buy/sell in HY. 


## Potential factors to consider
Spread 
Yield 
Breakeven (Δ price= − spread duration/∆spread) 
Macroeconomic outlook (regimes – an example set of economic conditions like rising unemployment/falling GDP, rising unemployment/rising inflation, etc) 
Our/consensus yield curve 
Inflation expectations 
Unemployment expectations 
Labor expectations 
Funds flows in/out of the market 
Built in demand 
Corporate default rate/loss given defaults 
CDS (HY CDX, IG CDX, ETFs) 
Equity markets
